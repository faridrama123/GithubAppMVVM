Android Architecture Components (MVVM) is one of the patterns released by Google. This collection of libraries helps you to design robust, testable and easily manageable       applications. The image above, is a big picture of Architecture Components. Each component has its own function. If broken down into components:

- View: It can be said as a UI controller or Fragment and Activity that serves to display data or perform actions in the UI.
- ViewModel: Provides data to the UI. Acts as a communication center between the Repository and the UI. The ViewModel function retains data from configuration changes.
- LiveData: Observable data holder class. Always holds/save latest version data. Notifies the observers when the data has changed. The UI component only observes or observes      relevant data and will not stop or continue to observe.
- Repository: You use the Repository to manage multiple data sources, such as network, local or cache origin.
- Room: Source of data from local database. Room is a library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to enable more robust database access by leveraging the power of SQLite.
- Rest Client: Data source originating from the network, such as Rest API, Firebase or other client data. 


## Built With
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - Is light wight threads for asynchronous programming
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
   - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
   - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
   - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
   - [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) - SQLite object mapping library.
- [Service Locator](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) - Alternative dependency injection,  dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. A dependency is an object that can be used (a service).
- [Hilt-android](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) Hilt provides a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
- [Dagger2](https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/) Dagger is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android (If you want to see this project using dagger, you can go to [this branch](https://github.com/Aditprayogo/GithubUsers/tree/old-dagger))
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) An HTTP & HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications.
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) A Java serialization/deserialization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling
- [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started) Material is a design system created by Google to help teams build high-quality digital experiences for Android, iOS, Flutter, and the web.
- [Encryption with SQLCipher](https://github.com/sqlcipher/android-database-sqlcipher)
- Obfuscation with Proguard
- Certificate Pinning with OkHttp
